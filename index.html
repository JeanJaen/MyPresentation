            <section>
                Working at Safran Electronics and Defense (near Paris) in the
                "Periscope" team. We design, test and repair electro-optical sights for submarines! I had two
                missions...
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Test automation</h2>
                Designed and implemented an overall testing architecture with TestStand to perform unit tests on our devices.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The most satisfying part was when we started doing endurance tests during the night to save us time...
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Updating the database</h2>
                We store all device parameters (600 params/devices)
                <br/>
                <br/>
                    But... the web application remained the same since 2007! LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) environment
                <br/>
                <br/>
                    Hardest part : history management, deal with the Information Systems department

                <h2>Blockchain</h2>
                I discovered blockchains and cryptocurrencies in 2019. I started investing at first but quickly shifted toward
                making DApps (Web App for DeFi). It is since then my main hobby :)
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Front-end</h2>
                To build such DApp I deep dived into modern Front-end technologies. Mainly React with TypeScript as well as few common blockchain libraries (Web3.js, ethers.js, etc.)
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I also learned Solidity but I am far away from being a blockchain engineer :/

            <section>
                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                Last but not least, I used to play (A LOT) of competitive video games such as Counter Strike or League of Legends
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Otherwise I am a Nintendo fan!

                I’d love to get coffee and get to know you, so don’t hesitate to get in touch.
